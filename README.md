## Task - 1: Project Overview
A data analyst acts as a bridge between business objectives and data-driven insights.

Accenture’s Managing Director, Mae Mulligan, leads the client engagement for Social Buzz. She has reviewed the client’s brief and assembled a skilled Accenture team to execute the project successfully. The internal Accenture team is set to have a project kickoff meeting tomorrow morning.

### About Client: [Social Buzz](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Data_Analytics%20Client%20Brief.pdf)

**Challenge:** Due to rapid expansion, the client faces difficulties in managing their large-scale operations.

### Accenture’s Objectives:
1. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the client’s big data practices.
2. Provide recommendations for an Initial Public Offering (IPO).
3. Analyze content popularity trends.

### Role of a Data Analyst:
The analyst needs to examine sample datasets and create visualizations to determine the most popular content categories.

**Final Requirement:** Provide an analysis highlighting the **top 5 most popular content categories**.

---
## Task - 2: Data Selection and Cleaning
To determine the most popular content categories, only relevant datasets should be used. The selected datasets include:

- **Reaction Score** (quantifies content popularity)
- **Content ID**
- **Reaction Types**
- **Content Type**
- **Category**

### Data Cleaning Steps:
1. Remove rows with missing or incomplete values.
2. Modify data types where necessary for consistency.
3. Eliminate columns that are not relevant to the analysis.

After cleaning, the final dataset will include three structured tables:

 - [Reaction Types](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/ReactionTypes.csv)
 - [Reactions](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Reactions.csv)
 - [Content](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Content.csv)


### Data Modeling: 
This is the provided [Data Model](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Data%20model.pdf).
Merge the three datasets into a single, refined dataset for further analysis.

**Final Output:**
- A structured and cleaned dataset.
- A list of the **top 5 content categories** based on popularity.
  
 ### Cleaned Data set:
 So, the cleaned data set after data modelling & data cleaning : [Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Cleaned%20Dataset.xlsx)

## Task - 3: Data Visualization and Storytelling
The insights must be presented visually using a PowerPoint presentation, following the prescribed template.

### Charts to Include:
- **Pie Chart**
- **Bar Chart**

 - Powerpoint Presentation : [PPT](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/PowerPoint%20presentation.pptx)

## Task - 4: Presenting Insights
The final step involves presenting the PowerPoint to the client, explaining the key takeaways from the analysis and highlighting data-driven recommendations.
